#  Emotion Classification from Speech using CNN and Spectrograms

This project implements a deep learning pipeline to classify human emotions from speech audio using **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** trained on **spectrogram images**. The model identifies emotions such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, **calm**, and more.

---

##  Project Overview

The goal is to automatically detect the emotional state of a speaker based on their vocal patterns. The system uses spectrograms derived from audio files and trains a CNN to recognize emotion categories with high accuracy.

---

##  Dataset

- Emotion-labeled speech audio files
- Labels include: `angry`, `happy`, `sad`, `neutral`, `calm`, `fearful`, `disgust`, `surprised`
- Audio files were preprocessed into spectrograms

---

## Preprocessing Methodology

1. **Audio Loading**:  
   Used `librosa` to load `.wav`/`.mp3` files at a consistent sample rate (e.g., 22050 Hz)

2. **Spectrogram Generation**:  
   - Created **Mel-spectrograms** using `librosa.feature.melspectrogram`
   - Converted power spectrogram to decibel units with `librosa.power_to_db`

3. **Image Conversion**:  
   - Saved spectrograms as grayscale or RGB images (`.png` or `.jpg`) of size `128x128`
   - Organized images into labeled folders for training
